# Key Concepts 

- Tokenization: Segmenting text into words, punctuations marks etc.
- Part-of-speech: (POS) Tagging Assigning word types to tokens, like verb or noun.
- Dependency Parsing: Assigning syntactic dependency labels, describing the relations between individual tokens, like subject or object.
- Lemmatization: Assigning the base forms of words. For example, the lemma of "was" is "be", and the lemma of "rats" is "rat".
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Labelling named "real-world" objects, like persons, companies or locations.
- Similarity: Comparing words, text spans and documents and how similar they are to each other.
- Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD): Finding and segmenting individual sentences.
- Text Classification: Assigning categories or labels to a whole document, or parts of a document.
- Rule-based Matching: Finding sequences of tokens based on their texts and linguistic annotations, similar to regular expressions.
